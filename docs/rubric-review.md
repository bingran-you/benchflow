# Rubric review

BenchFlow automatically reviews a task when it ships a weighted `rubric.json`.
A reviewer agent reads the solver's workspace, trajectory, test output, and task
definition in a separate sandbox. Host code validates its judgments and computes
the final reward. Tasks without a review rubric retain their existing verifier.

Workspace capture requires Python 3.10 or newer inside the solver image.
Before the solver starts, BenchFlow checks the interpreter and installs it
through the image's package manager when needed (apt, apk, dnf, microdnf, or
yum). Images without one of these package managers must provide a compatible
`python3`. A setup failure stops the run before solver execution.

The standalone `bench review` command remains a detached audit: it writes a
report without modifying the source result. Both entry points share the same
reviewer runtime, rubric contract, and weighted scorer. `bench eval score`
explicitly finishes or revises automatic scoring from a saved solver snapshot.

## Automatic evaluation

```bash
bench eval run --tasks-dir ./tasks/example \
  --agent codex-acp --model azure-foundry-openai/gpt-5.6-terra \
  --sandbox daytona --reasoning-effort max \
  --reviewer-agent codex-acp \
  --reviewer-model azure-foundry-openai/gpt-5.6-terra \
  --reviewer-sandbox daytona --reviewer-reasoning-effort max
```

The default pinned reviewer image installs `numpy==2.2.6` and `pypdf==5.9.0`
during trusted setup, before the agent starts. Its network restrictions remain
unchanged. Custom reviewer images supply their own artifact-reading tools.

Reviewer defaults are `opencode`, its registered model, Docker, 1800 seconds,
and concurrency 4. Set reviewer options explicitly when using a different
provider or backend. API keys and supported native OAuth are resolved through
normal BenchFlow credential handling; solver environment overrides do not become
reviewer overrides. Missing reviewer configuration or authentication is rejected
before solver startup. Backend preflight checks local configuration/readiness;
it does not guarantee a key will remain valid or a service will remain available.

Automatic discovery recognizes `verifier/rubric.json`, `tests/rubric.json`, and
root `rubric.json`. Multiple review rubrics are rejected as ambiguous. Malformed
or legacy v0.1 review rubrics require correction/migration before automatic
scoring. A recognized `{id, match_criteria}` LLM-judge rubric keeps its existing
verifier meaning and does not trigger a second review.

For a fully scored task, success and reward are different fields:

```text
passed = all required tests pass AND every blocker rubric passes
quality = sum(non-blocker score * weight) / sum(2 * weight)
reward = quality if passed else 0
```

For example, test reward 1, all blockers passing, and quality 0.8 produces
`scoring.passed=true` and `rewards.reward=0.8`. It counts as a pass in pass@1.
Quality zero can also coexist with gate success. Reports use the explicit pass
flag, never a threshold on the final reward. Old results without a scoring block
keep their historical reward-one pass contract. The deterministic verifier must
attest execution and passage of all its required checks with a valid reward of
exactly one; a partial test score does not satisfy the gate.

Terminal evaluation freezes the actual solver working directory before verifier
hardening, captures durable evidence, runs tests, finalizes telemetry, and releases
the solver sandbox before waiting for reviewer capacity. The reviewer receives
read-only evidence plus its own writable workspace. File manifests and archive
hashes validate transfers; required capture failures are scoring errors, not
scientific zeros. Intermediate test feedback does not run the reviewer.

Evidence never silently drops a path. Credential files, sandbox-provider runtime
state (Daytona's `~/.daytona` session tree, which sits inside a `/root`
workspace), and sockets, FIFOs or device nodes are left out of the bundle, and
each is listed in the manifest's `exclusions` with its reason (`credential`,
`sandbox_runtime`, `special_file`, or a task's own `task_exclude`). Capture
limits, symlinks that escape the workspace, and files that change during capture
still fail it.

Artifacts retain `solver.json`, the workspace bundle under `evidence/`, every
reviewer child under `reviews/`, and immutable reports under `scoring/`. Final
`result.json` includes a typed scoring block plus `reward`, `verifier_reward`,
and `rubric_reward` components. Reviewer trajectories, generated files, timing,
usage, and errors stay inspectable as child-run artifacts and are excluded from
solver-trial counts. Provider traces unavailable under supported native OAuth
remain explicitly unavailable rather than being fabricated.

If review fails, final reward stays unavailable and the successful solver/test
evidence is retained. Resume the job or use `bench eval score` with the exact
original task. Review retries never rerun the solver. Valid negative reviews are
not retried automatically. Publication failures are separate from scoring failure.
For manually driven `Rollout` phases, call `await rollout.finalize()` after the
terminal verifier; `.result` stays unavailable until required review finishes.
`bf.run()` and `TaskRuntime.verify()` perform this finalization automatically.

## The rubric (versionless contracts v0.1 and v0.2)

A rubric is a JSON file with one `criteria` list and no in-file version key.
BenchFlow identifies its contract from the fields present on every criterion.

### Legacy v0.1 rubric

The original shape remains fully supported:

```json
{
  "criteria": [
    {
      "name": "reward_hacking",
      "description": "Author-facing note about why this criterion exists.",
      "guidance": "Study the recorded run under trial/ for signs the agent manipulated grading instead of doing the work. PASS when ... FAIL when ... NOT_APPLICABLE when ..."
    }
  ]
}
```

Each v0.1 criterion is exactly three strings:

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `name` | Stable identifier. Becomes a field in the reviewer's structured-output schema, so it must be a valid Python identifier. |
| `description` | Documentation for humans reading the rubric. **Never included in the reviewer prompt** — grading must not depend on it. |
| `guidance` | The grading contract the reviewer follows. Put the full pass/fail/not-applicable conditions here. |

The reviewer answers each criterion with `pass`, `fail`, or `not_applicable`
plus a non-empty explanation. There are no weights, gates, thresholds, or
aggregate scores. Consumers read per-criterion outcomes from the report and
apply their own policy.

### Weighted v0.2 rubric

The weighted contract used by
[FrontierPhysics PR #109](https://github.com/benchflow-ai/FrontierPhysics/pull/109)
adds `blocker` and `weight` to **every** criterion:

```json
{
  "criteria": [
    {
      "name": "required_artifact",
      "blocker": 1,
      "weight": 10,
      "description": "The required artifact must be present and usable.",
      "guidance": "PASS only when the evidence contains the complete artifact. Otherwise FAIL."
    },
    {
      "name": "technical_quality",
      "blocker": 0,
      "weight": 8,
      "description": "Quality of the technical result.",
      "guidance": "Score 0 for incorrect, 1 for partially correct, or 2 for complete and correct."
    }
  ]
}
```

`blocker` is a strict integer `0` or `1`; `weight` is a strict integer from
`1` through `10`. Booleans, numeric strings, floats, omitted fields, and mixed
v0.1/v0.2 criteria are rejected. A v0.2 rubric must contain at least one
non-blocker criterion so its quality denominator is nonzero.

- A criterion with `blocker: 1` receives `pass` or `fail`. Any failure closes
  the blocker gate. Its `weight` is validated for a uniform authoring format
  but is excluded from weighted quality.
- A criterion with `blocker: 0` receives an integer score of `0`, `1`, or `2`.
  Its contribution is `score * weight` out of `2 * weight`.

BenchFlow aggregates a structurally valid v0.2 review on the host:

```text
raw_quality = sum(score * weight) / (2 * sum(non-blocker weights))
gates_pass = preserved deterministic test reward is 1.0 and valid
             AND every blocker passes
gated_quality = raw_quality if gates_pass, otherwise 0
```

The raw quality remains visible when a gate fails, making the rubric judgment
auditable without mistaking it for a publishable result. A failed gate always
produces `not_publishable`. With both gates open, the publication bands are:

| Gated quality | Decision |
|---|---|
| `>= 0.80` | `publishable` |
| `>= 0.65` and `< 0.80` | `presentable_with_revisions` |
| `< 0.65` | `not_publishable` |

### Validation and discovery

A rubric must contain at least one criterion, names must be unique, and
unknown fields are rejected. (Validation is stricter than the shape alone
requires: rubrics that would produce vacuous or ambiguous reviews are
refused.) `rubric.json` is an overloaded filename —
llm-judge verifier rubrics use `{id, match_criteria}` entries. Discovery is
fail-closed: a `rubric.json` is treated as a review rubric — and validated
loudly — **unless** every entry carries the full judge shape (both `id`
and `match_criteria`). Unreadable files, invalid JSON, empty or missing
`criteria`, and misspelled keys are all claimed and rejected with an
explicit error rather than silently replaced by the default rubric.

Detached `bench review` resolution order, per reviewed rollout:

1. an explicit `--rubric/-r` file,
2. the reviewed task's own `verifier/rubric.json`, `tests/rubric.json`, or root `rubric.json`
   when it is shaped like a review rubric,
3. the built-in default rubric (`reward_hacking`, `task_specification`).

## Running a review

```bash
# review one rollout
bench review jobs/<job>/<rollout> --sandbox docker \
  --model gemini/gemini-2.5-flash --tasks-root ./tasks

# review every rollout in a job, eight at a time, on Daytona
bench review jobs/<job> --sandbox daytona -n 8 \
  --model gemini/gemini-2.5-flash --tasks-root ./tasks

# audit the winners for grader manipulation
bench review jobs/<job> --passing --model gemini/gemini-2.5-flash

# analyze the losers for specification gaps
bench review jobs/<job> --failing -r spec-rubric.json \
  --model gemini/gemini-2.5-flash
```

`--passing` selects rollouts with reward 1.0 and no recorded error;
`--failing` selects everything else, including rollouts whose `result.json`
is unreadable. The reviewer agent (`--agent`, default `opencode`) and model
(`--model`; agents without a registry default require one — pass a gateway
model id such as `gemini/gemini-2.5-flash`) are independent of whatever ran
the original job.

## How a review executes

Each review is an ordinary rollout of a throwaway wrapper task assembled on
the host, which is why every sandbox backend (`docker`, `daytona`,
`agentcore`, ...) works unchanged:

- **Prebuilt image, pinned by digest.** The wrapper declares a
  digest-pinned `python` image and ships no Dockerfile, so Docker and
  Daytona never build one. AgentCore is the exception: it must wrap any
  image with its runtime-contract shim, so it still builds and pushes a
  derived ECR image once per distinct image, then reuses it.
- **Evidence by upload, outside the workdir.** A copy of the rollout
  directory is uploaded to `/evidence/trial`. A task copy is uploaded to
  `/evidence/task` only when it is admitted through the trusted-root and
  digest checks below. `/evidence` sits outside the agent workdir; after all
  uploads, a pre-agent hook fails closed unless the whole tree can be made
  root-owned, readable, and non-writable by the reviewer. Prior review
  outputs are excluded from the copy, so a
  re-review can never read an earlier verdict; symlinks anywhere in the
  evidence are dropped, never dereferenced; task skills and any shipped
  `rubric.json` are excluded from the task copy. The canonical ACP trajectory
  is retained. When an ACP implementation drops a completed tool observation
  or reduces a command title to the generic tool name, BenchFlow reconciles
  the missing detail from the matching exact-ID event in its trusted provider
  capture before the canonical record is finalized.
  The cumulative provider-history `llm_trajectory.jsonl` remains omitted: it
  repeats the growing conversation on every request and can exhaust a reviewer
  model's context. The reviewed rollout itself is never touched.
- **Post-initialization egress restriction, fail closed.** The wrapper
  declares `allow_internet: false`, which disables web tools, forces the
  model proxy sandbox-local, and arms the agent-UID egress firewall scoped
  to that loopback gateway. Backends that cannot enforce isolation (for
  example `agentcore`, whose runtime only offers PUBLIC/VPC networking)
  refuse the review at launch; `--allow-open-network` is the explicit,
  report-recorded override for them.

  Be precise about what this guarantees: the container needs network during
  image setup and agent installation, so the firewall is armed *after* the
  reviewer harness starts and completes ACP initialization. The guarantee is
  **restricted egress for the graded portion of the run**, not
  network isolation for the container's whole lifetime. Evidence is uploaded during
  sandbox setup, before the firewall is enforced, so a reviewer harness
  that is itself malicious could egress during startup **after evidence is
  present**. Treat the reviewer harness as trusted code; the untrusted
  input is the evidence it reads, and this guarantee constrains the graded
  portion of the run, not a hostile harness.
- **Task evidence requires an explicitly trusted root.** A rollout's
  recorded `task_path` is rollout-authored data, so it is never read
  directly — pass `--tasks-root <dir>` and the task is looked up *by name*
  beneath that root. Without it, the review proceeds from run records alone
  and says so in the trial's `notes`. When the rollout recorded a
  `task_digest` in `result.json` or `config.json`, the values must be valid
  and mutually consistent. A missing digest, mismatch against the on-disk
  task, conflict, or any verification failure **excludes the task from
  evidence** and says so in `notes`; an old or unverifiable rollout is never
  reviewed against current task content.
- **The rubric never enters the sandbox.** It is decomposed host-side:
  `guidance` lines render into the instruction; names and the minimum contract
  metadata needed for structural validation become the output schema and
  `tests/criteria.json`. `description` goes nowhere.
- **Validity-only reward.** The wrapper's verifier is a stdlib-only
  structural check of the reviewer's `review-result.json` (every criterion
  answered, outcomes or scores in the contract's vocabulary, non-empty
  explanations). Its reward remains structural for both rubric contracts:
  reward 1.0 means "a well-formed review exists" — never "the reviewed run
  was good." Weighted quality and publication decisions are separate,
  deterministic host-side report fields.
- **Failure isolation.** A review that crashes or produces malformed output
  becomes an error entry for that rollout; the rest of the job continues.

## Output

The review job directory contains `review_report.json`. This v0.1 example has
no aggregate score:

```json
{
  "path": "…/jobs/2026-08-03__12-00-00",
  "rubric": {"path": "…", "criteria": ["…"], "contracts": ["v0.1"]},
  "reviewer": {"agent": "opencode", "model": "gemini/gemini-2.5-flash", "environment": "docker", "network": "no-internet"},
  "job_summary": "Deterministic aggregation over VALID reviews only.",
  "trials": [
    {
      "trial_name": "hello-world-task__829cddb8",
      "source_rollout": "…",
      "review_valid": true,
      "summary": "Three-to-five sentence account of the run.",
      "checks": {
        "reward_hacking": {"explanation": "…", "outcome": "pass"},
        "task_specification": {"explanation": "…", "outcome": "fail"}
      },
      "error": null,
      "reviewer_rollout": "…/runtime/hello-world-task__829cddb8/<run-id>/…",
      "rubric_path": "…/verifier/rubric.json",
      "rubric_contract": "v0.1",
      "criteria": ["reward_hacking", "task_specification"],
      "criterion_metadata": [
        {"name": "reward_hacking", "blocker": null, "weight": null},
        {"name": "task_specification", "blocker": null, "weight": null}
      ],
      "scoring": null,
      "notes": ["task evidence skipped: no --tasks-root was given"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Each reviewer rollout's own records (trajectory, verifier output, raw
`review-result.json`) sit under the report's `runtime/` directory for
audit; every invocation uses a fresh unique runtime leaf. When a leaf is
successfully identified, `reviewer_rollout` points at that exact leaf;
otherwise it is `null` rather than an ambiguous parent directory. Reusing
`--out-dir` can therefore never resurface a stale review. The job summary is a deterministic
aggregation, not a model call — a host-side LLM call would bypass the
sandbox backend, egress policy, and telemetry.

For v0.2, blocker checks carry `outcome`, scored checks carry `score`, and the
trial also records its rubric contract, criterion metadata, and deterministic
aggregation. The scoring object has this shape:

```json
{
  "deterministic_pass": true,
  "all_blockers_pass": true,
  "failed_blockers": [],
  "weighted_points": 24,
  "max_weighted_points": 30,
  "raw_quality": 0.8,
  "gated_quality": 0.8,
  "decision": "publishable"
}
```

Aggregation is emitted only for a structurally valid v0.2 review. The report
keeps each trial's resolved contract and criterion metadata authoritative,
because one job may review tasks with different task-local rubrics.

## Writing good criteria

- Put the entire decision rule in `guidance`. For v0.1, include when to answer
  `not_applicable` (for example: infrastructure failure before the agent ever
  attempted the task). V0.2 has no `not_applicable`: define exact `pass` /
  `fail` conditions for blockers and exact `0` / `1` / `2` anchors for scored
  criteria.
- One judgment per criterion. A criterion that bundles several claims makes
  a blocker verdict or numeric score ambiguous.
- The reviewer reads evidence produced by the solver. Guidance should direct
  it to concrete records (`trial/result.json`, `trial/trajectory/`,
  `trial/verifier/`) rather than to intent.
- `description` is the right place for authorship context you do not want
  influencing the judge — provenance, rationale, links.
