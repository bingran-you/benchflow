# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Registry-pinned dataset runs** — `bench eval create -d name@version`
  (e.g. `-d skillsbench@1.1`) resolves a dataset from a git-backed
  `registry.json` (see skillsbench `docs/dataset-versioning.md`): tasks are
  cloned at their pinned `git_commit_id` into `.cache/datasets` and every
  task directory is verified against its sha256 content digest before
  anything runs; the entry's `bench_version` range is checked against the
  installed benchflow. `--registry` overrides the default (skillsbench)
  registry. `result.json`/`config.json` are stamped with `dataset_name`,
  `dataset_version`, and a per-task `task_digest` (`summary.json` carries
  the name/version); `--tasks-dir` dev runs carry no dataset fields but
  still stamp a live-computed `task_digest`, so every trajectory stays
  attributable to exact task content. `bench tasks digest <dir>` prints
  the digest for task authoring, and `check_results.py` audits the stamps.
  See [`docs/running-benchmarks.md`](docs/running-benchmarks.md). (#689,
  #690, #691; `packaging` promoted to a core dependency for the
  `bench_version` check.)

- **`benchflow continue <run-folder>`** — resume a previous, unfinished
  (timed-out) `openhands` run to completion. A standalone tool (it does not
  touch the normal run path) that reconstructs the run's exact workspace and
  agent memory from the recorded `llm_trajectory.jsonl` via record-replay,
  then continues with the live model — no injected prompt — and writes a new
  HF-compatible folder with `continued_from` provenance. See
  [`docs/continue-runs.md`](docs/continue-runs.md).

### Changed

- Document the public vs internal preview install/upgrade command matrix,
  including `uv tool` exact pins, internal preview upgrades, and the
  `--force` path for replacing stale entrypoint scripts.

## 0.5.2 — 2026-06-05

### Changed

- **PyPI project README badge** — replace the dynamic PyPI version badge with
  a stable package badge so the rendered project description cannot show a
  stale external version image after a public release.
- **Release documentation refresh** — update public install snippets,
  release-channel docs, examples, and citation metadata to `0.5.2`.

## 0.5.1 — 2026-06-05

### Added

- **Daytona usage telemetry by default** — Daytona runs now start a sandbox-local provider usage proxy so token/cost telemetry works without an external tunnel; use `--usage-tracking off` to bypass proxying when needed.
- **Azure AI Foundry providers** — new `azure-foundry-openai/` and `azure-foundry-anthropic/` prefixes routing through Foundry's unified resource. Export `AZURE_API_KEY` plus `AZURE_API_ENDPOINT` (e.g. `https://<resource>.openai.azure.com/`); benchflow derives the resource name from the endpoint host, builds the per-surface base URL, and maps the key onto the agent-native auth env automatically. Missing/unrecognized endpoints and unsupported agent/provider protocol pairings fail fast with clear errors instead of falling through to the wrong endpoint.
- **Azure Foundry auth guidance** — agent discovery output and docs now call out that provider-prefixed models can use provider-specific credentials instead of the agent's native/default API key.

### Changed

- **PyPI project documentation refresh** — the public package README, install snippets, release-channel docs, examples, and citation metadata now point at `0.5.1`.

### Fixed

- Inherit `BENCHFLOW_PROVIDER_BASE_URL` / `BENCHFLOW_PROVIDER_API_KEY` from the host environment so self-hosted / OpenAI-compatible endpoints route correctly instead of falling back to `api.openai.com`; empty or whitespace-only host values are skipped so they cannot shadow the resolved provider URL (benchflow-ai/skillsbench#817).

## 0.5.0 — 2026-06-04

### Added

- **Public/internal preview release channels** — tag-driven public releases publish stable PyPI packages and GitHub Releases; merges to `main` publish internal preview `.devN` packages after CI passes.
- **v0.5 integration evidence** — release validation docs now cover urgent blocker closure, SkillsBench infra-fix validation, adapter evidence, trace-to-task evidence, hosted env compatibility, and diagnostic fields.
- **Release automation guardrails** — public release tags must point at commits contained in `main`, version tags must match `pyproject.toml`, and PyPI publishing uses Trusted Publishing/OIDC instead of stored tokens.

### Changed

- `main` now tracks the next public version as `0.5.1.dev0`; the published public SDK is `0.5.0`, and internal previews are emitted as `0.5.1.dev<N>`.
- Documentation now directs downstream users to depend on public PyPI releases by default and use prerelease-enabled internal previews only for validation before the next public cut.

### Fixed

- Closed the v0.5 release blocker set covering structured sandbox/verifier diagnostics, Daytona startup/export retries, verifier dependency classification, CTRF path consistency, and SkillsBench task compatibility evidence.

## 0.3.3 — 2026-05-15

### Added

- **Harvey LAB benchmark** — converter, agent shim, and parity validation for 1,251 legal AI tasks (#239).
- **Harvey LAB Claude Sonnet judge** — switched verifier from Gemini to `claude-sonnet-4-6`, matching the original benchmark default (#264).
- **ProgramBench integration** — new benchmark adapter; TB2 removed; `.ref/` migrated to `benchmarks/` (#237).
- **CLI progress output** — `bench eval create` / `bench run` now show progress messages by default (#264).

- **Docs overhaul** — synced from www.benchflow.ai; Mintlify config added then orphaned config removed (#259, #257, #226).
- **`uv sync`** for package management (#232).

## 0.2.3 — 2026-04-15

### Added

- `benchmarks/tb2_multiturn-claude-haiku45.yaml` — shipped config for the README's TB2 multi-turn Claude result.
- Daytona resource clamping via `BENCHFLOW_DAYTONA_MAX_CPUS` / `MAX_MEMORY_MB`.

### Changed

- Renamed `skillsbench-claude-glm5.yaml` → `skillsbench-claude-glm51.yaml` to match the model ID.
- `codex --login` correction in `docs/getting-started.md`.
- Restricted sdist build to `src/`, `tests/`, and metadata.

### Fixed

- Verifier sandbox hardening follow-ups across several base-image and tooling edge cases.
- Preserve trusted verifier path entries and workspace answer files.
- Redirect oracle output to container log.
- Align YAML path resolution to config file location.

## 0.2.2 — 2026-04-13

### Added

- **Sandbox hardening tiers 1–3** — layered defense (env scrubbing, path lockdown, workspace
  freeze, wider snapshot, oracle privilege drop) blocking F1–F6 red-team findings.
- **`labs/reward-hack-matrix`** — per-trial timeout support and 0.2.2 sweep handoff scripts.

### Fixed

- Multiple sandbox bypass vectors identified in red-team testing.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-04-12

### Added

- **Sandbox hardening on by default** — `sandbox_user` now defaults to `"agent"` (was `None`/root). Blocks conftest-hook and answer-lookup exploit patterns.
- **Path lockdown** — new `sandbox_locked_paths` parameter makes `/solution` and `/tests` read-only before the verifier runs, blocking `.pth`-injection and similar pre-verify tampering.
- **Verifier failure isolation** — agent errors and verifier errors are now stored separately; a crashing verifier no longer masks the agent result.
- **`labs/benchjack-sandbox-hardening`** — cookbook demonstrating three exploit patterns (P1 conftest-hook, P2 answer-lookup, P7 `.pth`-injection) and their defenses.

### Fixed

- **Oracle runs as `sandbox_user`** — oracle agent now respects path lockdown instead of running as root and bypassing it.
- **Multi-endpoint provider routing** — providers with multiple endpoints now route by the agent's native API protocol.
- **Stale API key shadowing subscription auth** — emits a warning when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var is present alongside `claude login` credentials.
- **pytest `ini`-injection bypass** — closed a verifier hardening edge case.

### Changed

- Version is now single-sourced via `importlib.metadata`; no more duplicate version string in `__init__.py`.
- **User-facing docs** — new `docs/` directory with getting-started guide, CLI reference, architecture overview, task-authoring guide, and labs index. README trimmed; detailed content moved to `docs/`.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-04-09

**First public release.** A near-complete rearchitecture from the 0.1.x era. API surface has changed — assume breaking changes. Future releases will maintain compatibility within the 0.2.x line. 0.1.x users should treat this as a fresh install; see `.dev-docs/sdk-reference.md` for the new SDK.

### Added

- **Multi-agent, multi-provider, multi-auth matrix** — one YAML config, any supported agent × model × provider × auth combination.
- **Subscription auth support** — use `claude login`, `codex --login`, `gemini` OAuth credentials directly. No API keys required for host-based agent workflows.
- **Vertex AI support** — ADC auth for `google-vertex/`, `anthropic-vertex/`, `vertex-zai/` prefixed models.
- **Provider registry** — add a new LLM endpoint via a dict entry in `providers.py`, no code changes.
- **`benchmarks/` directory** with reusable YAML configs and runner scripts for TB2 and SkillsBench.
- **Auto task download** — YAML configs reference datasets as `org/repo/path` (e.g. `harbor-framework/terminal-bench-2`). Repos are cloned on first use and cached under `.cache/datasets/`.
- **`benchflow tasks init`** — scaffold new tasks.
- **`benchflow tasks check`** — validate task structure.
- **`benchflow cleanup`** — delete old sandboxes with `--max-age` filtering (default 24h).
- **Oracle agent support** — run `solution/solve.sh` directly for task validation.
- **Hello-world-task example** for sanity-testing the agent pipeline.
- **Model generation params** via env vars (`BENCHFLOW_TEMPERATURE`, `BENCHFLOW_TOP_P`, `BENCHFLOW_MAX_TOKENS`).
- **OpenClaw ACP shim** with trajectory parsing and skills support.
- **ACP trajectory capture** — full multi-turn agent trajectories via ACP protocol.

### Changed

- **Skill loading** — agent-targeted with proper precedence; auto-distributed from `task.toml` `skills_dir`.
- **`openclaw-gemini` merged** into `openclaw` — provider mode selected at runtime via `BENCHFLOW_PROVIDER_NAME`.

### Fixed

- **API keys leaking in `ps aux`** — env vars now written inside the container instead of passed via Docker exec `-e`.
- **Subscription auth skipped without `-m`** — `benchflow run` without `--model` now checks correctly.
- **ADC credentials break with `sandbox_user`** (#111) — credentials written to sandbox user's home instead of `/root/`.
- **Daytona sandboxes not cleaned up** (#102) — auto-delete after max age.
- **`benchflow cleanup` ignoring `--max-age`** — was deleting everything regardless of age.
- **readline buffer overflow crashes trial** (#98).
- **OpenClaw ACP shim loses tool command text** (#96).
- **OpenClaw ACP shim hardcodes `anthropic/` prefix** (#95) — now routes correctly for Gemini/GLM models.
- **Oracle agent `PermissionError`** writing `agent/oracle.txt` (#91).
- **Oracle path skips `pre_agent_hooks`** (#92) — services now start before oracle runs.
- **Trial data parity with Harbor** (#90) — richer `result.json`, agent logs, per-phase timing.
- **`SDK.run()` `PermissionError`** — `jobs_dir` subdirectories created as root (#88).
- **Partial trajectory lost on timeout** — saved before timeout raises.
- **Redundant `--version` binary check** removed — was wasting 30s per trial.
- **Trajectory fallback** — scrapes agent-native files when ACP `session/update` is empty (#94).
- **`litellm` upgraded to 1.83.0** for CVE-2026-35030; transitive dep security alerts resolved (13 Dependabot alerts closed).

### Deprecated

- `BaseAgent` re-export — planned removal in 0.3.0
- `Trial` re-export — planned removal in 0.3.0
